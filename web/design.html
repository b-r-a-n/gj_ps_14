<h1 id="design-document-flame-fighters">Design Document: Flame Fighter</h1>
<p><em>Made for Pirate Software&#39;s Game Jam 14</em> (<a href="https://itch.io/jam/pirate">link</a>)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>
<p>A deadly fire is spreading. Limit the devastation by taking control of a fire fighting robot that can be used to extinguish the flames.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Each level is a grid of tiles. Some of the tiles are burning.</p>
<p>The player has a deck of cards that correspond to actions that can be taken by a robot that is also present in the grid.</p>
<p>Using their deck, the player must extinguish the flame before the fire spreads to every tile.</p>
<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>
<h4 id="level">Level</h4>
<p>Each level is a 2D grid of tiles.</p> 
<p>The level is complete when all burning tiles are extinguished.</p> 
<p>The level is failed if all of the non-robot tiles are burning.</p>
<h4 id="turn">Turn</h4>
<p>Each turn the player draws cards from their deck until their hand is full or there are no cards remaining.</p>
<p>The player may play as many cards as they are able each turn. Any unplayed cards remain in their hand.</p>
<p>At the end of the turn, each burning tile increases in intensity or spreads to nearby tiles (if it is at maximum intensity)</p>
<h4 id="cards">Cards</h4>
<p>The player's cards are drawn from a deck that is defined at the start of the level (what is in the deck depends on the game mode)</p>
<p>Cards can be played if the <strong>resources</strong> are available and, in the case of movement, the tile is not blocked.</p>
<p>When played, a card's actions are applied, the player's resources are consumed, and it is <strong>recycled</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Recylced</strong> cards go back into the deck once it is empty. The deck is shuffled when this happens.</p>
<p>Cards may also be <strong>discarded</strong>. Discarded cards are removed from the deck for the remainder of the level.</p>
<h4 id="tiles">Tiles</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burning:</strong> Burning tiles have 3 levels of intensity: Low, Medium, High. Each turn the intensity of the fire in each tile increases by one or spreads to nearby tiles (if it is at maximum intensity)</li> 
<li><strong>Wall:</strong>Tiles that prevent movement but are also fireproof.</li>
<li><strong>Empty:</strong>Tiles that can be moved onto and may also contain <strong>items</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Used by cards that extinguish fire</li>
    <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Used by cards that change the robot's position</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="items">Items</h4>
<p>Currently, there are 3 types of items.</p>
<p>Items are obtained by moving onto their tile during a level.</p>
<p>Items that are on a burning tile are destoryed.</p>
<ul><strong>Water:</strong> Restores 1 water resource</ul> 
<ul><strong>Battery:</strong> Restores 1 energy resource</ul> 
<ul><strong>Card:</strong> Adds a new card to the player's deck</ul> 
<h3>Modes</h3>
<p>There are two main modes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Puzzle mode: Pre-defined deck list and tile maps</li>
    <li>Rogue mode: Procedurally generated tile maps with deck-based progression</li>
</ul>
<p>Puzzle mode is mainly meant to be used as a tutorial and expose the player to the different mechanics</p>
<p>Rogue mode offers replayability and deckbuilding elements</p>
